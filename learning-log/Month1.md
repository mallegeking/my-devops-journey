# ðŸ“… Month (June) 2025 â€” My DevOps Progress

## Here is where I will write about everything I have covered during the first Month

## What I did so far:

- Set up this DevOps journey portfolio ðŸŽ‰
- Started learning about version control (Git and Github)
  Here are some of the resources I used to learn Git and GitHub:
  - [Pro Git Book (Online and Free)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): A step-by-step guide to learning Git and GitHub. I don't recommend reading the entire book, but it's a good starting point and it fits my initial goal which is to learn the essentials and get up to speed.
  - [](learngitbranching.js.org): An interactive online tool that helps you learn Git visually. It covers all the basics, has great excercises, and is fun to use. It's a great way to practice and understand how Git works behind the closed curtains.

## Aha moment ðŸ¤¯

- When I started learning Git, I already knew the basics like cloning from a remote repository, adding files, committing changes, and pushing to a remote repository. So I didn't really need to learn it all from scratch. However all this time, I didn't know that Git and Github are not the same thing. Going through the book and reading more about the Git Internals helped me understand more. I still use the book as a reference when I need an indepth understanding of certain aspects of Git. Learning git was definitely worth the time. Now I can navigat the system more confidently and consciously.
