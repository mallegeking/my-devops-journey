## Objective:

- Due to the lack of sufficient resources, I needed a way, an inexpensive way to make sure I can set up my Homelab, learn and work towards my goal. So I stumbled upon Proxmox.
- Proxmox is a virtualization platform that allows you to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine. It is open source and free to use.
- Since I have an old DellOptiplex 9080 and DellOptiplex 5040 sitting in my room, I decided to set up Proxmox on the Optiplex 9080 first so that I can learn the basics.

- The installation was relatively easy. I used the documentation on the Proxmox website to set up the server.
- I am currently learning the basics of proxmox from the following youtube channel: [Learn Linux TV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKHnlbYhtABg6cF50bYa8Ulo)
- This channel has a Full Course on Proxmox and it is very well done. It's definitely worth checking out if you want a solid understanding of Proxmox.

## What I did so far:
