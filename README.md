# 🌱 My DevOps Journey

Hi there! 👋 I'm currently on a self-driven journey to become a **DevOps Engineer** — and this is where I document every step of my learning.

Whether it's deploying apps in the cloud, writing automation scripts, or building CI/CD pipelines — I'm sharing it all here to:

- Track my growth
- Reflect on my learning
- Help others starting from zero like me

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- ✅ Learning Git & GitHub
- ✅ Mastering Linux & shell scripting
- 🔄 Docker & containerization
- 🔜 CI/CD pipelines
- 🔜 Cloud (AWS/GCP)

## 📁 Portfolio Structure

- 📖 [`/about`](./about) — My story, goals, and motivations

## 🧠 Why This Portfolio?

I believe in being self reliant and **self taught**. By documenting everything — the wins, the struggles, the “aha!” moments — I not only grow faster, but I also help others along the way.

Feel free to follow, fork, or reach out if you're on a similar path!
