# 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm Priviledge Zvidzai, a passionate learner and aspiring **DevOps Engineer** currently transitioning into tech.

### 🔧 Background

- 🌍 I'm based in Aachen, Germany but I am originally from Zimbabwe, from a city called Chitungwiza
- 💼 Currently doing an apprenticeship as an IT Specialist for system integration at the RWTH University and Berufskolleg für Gestaltung und Technik in Aachen
- 🧠 Self-taught learner focusing on Linux, automation, and cloud platforms

### 🎯 Why DevOps?

I've always been curious about how software actually runs — not just writing code, but _deploying_, _automating_, and _scaling_ it reliably. DevOps combines:

- Infrastructure
- Development practices
- Automation
- Collaboration

And that’s exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy!

### 📅 Long-Term Goals

- Become a certified cloud DevOps engineer (AWS/GCP)
- Venture into MLOPs
- Contribute to open source DevOps tools
- Help others on the same path

Let’s connect and grow together! 🚀
